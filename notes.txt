    Customer Obsession
        keep customer trust
        pay attention to competitors,

    Ownership
        Leaders are owners
        They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.
        They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.


    Invent and Simplify
        Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.

    Are Right, A Lot
        Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.


    Learn and Be Curious

    Hire and Develop the Best

        Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.
        They recognize exceptional talent.


    Insist on the Highest Standards

        many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.
