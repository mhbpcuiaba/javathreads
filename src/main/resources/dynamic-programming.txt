* Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems.
* It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems.
* The method takes far less time than other methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap.
* We need to solve different parts of the problem(subproblems) + combine the solutions of the subproblems to reach an overall solution.
* We solve each subproblems only once -> we reduce the number of computations.
* Subproblems can be stored (memoization)


Dynamic programming VS divide and conquer

    * Several problems can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems
    * This strategy is called "divide and conquer"
    * This is why merge sort/quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.
    * Overlapping subproblems -> dynamic programming
    * Non-overlapping subproblems -> divide and conquer
